    <h3>I had no idea this even existed but after reading one of the versions of the "Motherfucking website" I realized you can modify the size between lines? And people actually change it from the default?? And even big companies??? Like that is defenetly something I would never think of, well maybe I would if I was going for a ui/ux position but defenetly not like this, anyways take that lorem ipsum, I don't need you <:</h3>
    <h1>So like a title<br>With moutltiple lines<br>Is cool or whatever.</h1>
    <p>Nah I just needed a title to experimennt with the line size thing anyway do you wanna hear a joke? So basically a guy walks into a bar, and then he sees 3 men, a russian, an american and a german, so he asks russian what do you use for example text and he says "I use lorem" and then suddenly a Ukrainian kicks the door of the bar open and says "I use custom text, btw". So anyways thats how to Russia Ukraine war begun, and I wonder, when the time comes for somebody to read this, would the war already be over?</p>
