                Uhm hi there so uhh I was paid a lot of money by the sponsors to make this guide so I can earn a lot of money myself so you should defenetly listen to me. So the first thing you gotta do is click on the uhm link on the left and sign up for the uhhh thing, and then you gotta click the thing on the right and uhh buy the uhh thing and then after serving in the military come back to this website and if it still exists then you might win a lottery ticket. And if you do win a lot of money and this step is really important, go ahead and give the link to the right a click and make sure to check out our second sponsor and they will take care of all the money that you have won.

        <div class="footnote">
            None of the stuff said is true we are not advising anyone to do anything this is entirely a joke we are not responcible for any injury claims and you can't sue us because we said so. Please have fun reading but do remember that you are not entittled to do anything however your actions on this website may or may not contribute to me getting extra money from my sponsors. Make your decisions visely but we are not responcible for them. Who actually reads these though like I could say anything here, but seriosly though this is a joke do not sign up for the military unless you want to lol. Anyway what else do people talk about in the footnote? Probably some other legal stuff Im clueless about or like specifications for stuff that didnt fit on the web page, anyone Im just trying to make this look long so it actually looks like a footnote and I think I ahve achived it now.
